 * Singleton Design Pattern: it ensures a class only has one instance and provide a global point of to
 * access it.
 * 
 * There can be many ways for creating Singleton class(that has atmost 1 instance across the application).
 * -> 1st way -> see code: ClassicalSingletonPattern(not complete gurantee)
 * -> 2nd way -> see code: Way2SingletonPattern(performance issue)
 * -> 3rd way -> see code: Way3EagerSingletonPattern(Eager initialization)
 * -> 4th way -> see code: Way4DCLSingletonPattern(uses DCL, not used in java 5 or earlier versions)
